# Reschedule cards later
## Rationale
Some people find anki frustrating because it does not forgive you if
you skip a day or a week. When you come back, anki tells you to review
many days of cards immediatly. That's overwhelming, and sometime, it
makes people quit anki.

While anki's right in a theoretical sens, it is wrong in a practical
sens. It may be better for the memory to see everything as soon as
possible. But in practice, it's even better to be late and not to quit
anki. 

This add-on is thus made for those people, who knows they are human,
and not perfect machine. Who knows that it's better to cheat with anki
a little bit than to quit it. This add-on change the due date of every
cards already learned once, and add to it as many day as you want.

If you want to go one week in holiday, just add 7 days to every cards,
and you'll see the same number of cards as usual when you come
back. (Note however that you may find that you have forgotten more
cards than usual).

### Second constraint
This add-on should also satisfies a second constraint. You don't need
it to review cards.

You'll use this add-on to change the due date of cards. But once it's
done and you have synchronized your deck, you can see the cards on any
computer, phone, or using ankiweb.

## Usage
You can either add delays to every cards or only to selected one.

### All cards
In the main window, open ```tools``` then ```Postpone cards```. 

### Selected cards
In the browser, select every card you want to move. Select ```Edit```,
then select ```Postpone cards```, and the delay will only be
added to cards which you have selecteds and which are due.

### Both cases
A window will ask you how many days of delay you want to
add. Enter the number, and press ok.

The number can be either negative or positive. It means you can also
remove days. This may mostly be useful if you figure out you have
added to many days.
